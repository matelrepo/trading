The standard CPI fails to account for price drops resulting from improved production technologies, so the chained CPI was crafted to allow for a continuously changing basket of goods.</p><p><b>Units: </b>Index Points 2018M12=100, NSA</p><p><b>Source: </b><a href =http://www.bankofbotswana.bw/>Bank of Botswana</a></p>",2019-11-16 00:34:43,1996-01-31,2019-10-31

CANCPI,Canada - Consumer Price Index (CPI),"<p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of inflation related to the cost of living. It tracks the prices of essential goods and services like food and healthcare, and weighs those price changes according to their relative importance. The overall change in prices is the inflation rate, which can be positive or negative. The standard CPI fails to account for price drops resulting from improved production technologies, so the chained CPI was crafted to allow for a continuously changing basket of goods.</p><p><b>Units: </b>Index Points 2002=100, NSA</p><p><b>Source: </b><a href =http://www.statcan.gc.ca/>Statistics Canada</a></p>",2019-11-21 00:46:01,1950-01-31,2019-10-31

It tracks the prices of essential goods and services like food and healthcare, and weighs those price changes according to their relative importance. The overall change in prices is the inflation rate, which can be positive or negative. The standard CPI fails to account for price drops resulting from improved production technologies, so the chained CPI was crafted to allow for a continuously changing basket of goods.</p><p><b>Units: </b>Index Points 2011=100, NSA</p><p><b>Source: </b>Institut National de la Statistique du Cameroun</p>",2019-11-24 01:45:09,2013-01-31,2019-09-30

The overall change in prices is the inflation rate, which can be positive or negative. The standard CPI fails to account for price drops resulting from improved production technologies, so the chained CPI was crafted to allow for a continuously changing basket of goods.</p><p><b>Units: </b>Index Points Sept 2016=100</p><p><b>Source: </b>Cayman Islands - The Economics & Statistics Office</p>",2019-09-13 04:03:42,2011-03-31,2019-03-31

It tracks the prices of essential goods and services like food and healthcare, and weighs those price changes according to their relative importance.

The standard CPI fails to account for price drops resulting from improved production technologies, so the chained CPI was crafted to allow for a continuously changing basket of goods.</p><p><b>Units: </b>Index Points 1980=100, NSA</p><p><b>Source: </b><a href =http://www.scb.se/en_/>Statistics Sweden</a></p>",2019-12-12 01:06:23,1960-01-31,2019-11-30
